# Summary

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example, see Figure \@ref(fig:iris).

```{r iris, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Obligatory iris plot"}
ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Length, Petal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Irises",
       subtitle = "The most boring plot in the world")
```

## Including tables

You can also include nicely formatted tables, like Table \@ref(tab:cars2).

```{r cars2}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars), caption = "Some info about cars.", booktabs = TRUE)
```


## Markdown extensions

This template is built on top of `bookdown`, which enables several extensions to `pandoc` markdown, including cross references. For a full overview of these extensions, see the [`bookdown` book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).
