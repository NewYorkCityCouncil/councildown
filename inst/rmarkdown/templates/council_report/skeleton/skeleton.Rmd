# Summary

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example, see Figure \@ref(fig:pressure).

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "A graph of temperature versus pressure."}
plot(pressure)
```

## Including tables

You can also include nicely formatted tables, like \@ref(tab:cars2).

```{r cars2}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars), caption = "Some info about cars.", booktabs = TRUE)
```
