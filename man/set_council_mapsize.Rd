\title{Set Leaflet Map Size and Position}
\usage{
set_council_mapsize(map, layout = "full_screen")
}
\arguments{
\item{map}{A leaflet map object created by `leaflet::leaflet()`.}

\item{layout}{A character string specifying one of the pre-defined layouts.
Defaults to `"full_screen"`. The available options are:
\itemize{
  \item `"full_screen"`: The map fills the entire browser viewport (100% width, 100% height).
  \item `"right"`: The map fills the right 75% of the viewport width and 100% of the height.
  \item `"left"`: The map fills the left 75% of the viewport width and 100% of the height.
  \item `"top"`: The map fills the top 75% of the viewport height and 100% of the width.
  \item `"bottom"`: The map fills the bottom 75% of the viewport height and 100% of the width.
}}
}
\value{
A modified leaflet map object that will render in the specified layout.
  The object remains a `leaflet` map, so it can be piped into other functions.
}
\description{
Modifies a leaflet map widget's size and position using pre-defined layouts.
This is achieved by injecting CSS to style the map's container. It's ideal
for creating standalone map pages, dashboards, or reports.
}
\details{
This function uses `htmlwidgets::prependContent` to add a `<style>` tag to
the map's HTML dependencies. The generated CSS will vary based on the chosen
`layout`. For directional layouts (e.g., `"right"`), the map will occupy 75%
of the viewport, leaving the remaining 25% free for other content like text
or controls in your R Markdown or HTML document.
